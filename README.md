## Welcome to Lokesh Lagudu's Blog

Personally, I am an ardent follower of sports and a complete movie/TV show buff. Unlike anyone else, how I think is all been shaped by my life's experience. One thing I would say that defines me is I Love to Learn. I get excited about new things. I buy more books than I complete. I buy more things than I use. I have more friends than I need. The thing is about, I see people doing great things and learning from them is the one that truly excites me.
